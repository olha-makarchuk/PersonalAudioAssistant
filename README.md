Client Application (.NET MAUI) and Audio Server (Python)
This repository contains two main components of the intelligent dialogue agent system:

Client Application:
Developed using .NET MAUI and C#, this cross-platform mobile application provides the user interface and handles user interaction, voice input, and communication with backend services. The client follows the MVVM pattern to ensure clean separation between UI and business logic.

Audio Server:
Built with Python and FastAPI, the audio server processes voice data, performs speech recognition, voice identification, synthesis, and voice cloning using integrated AI models. This server handles audio-specific tasks separately to optimize system performance and scalability.

Both components interact with the main backend server to ensure a smooth, secure, and personalized voice interaction experience for users.
